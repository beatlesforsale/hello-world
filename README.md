Hi mortals.,

Some random dude with huge interest in learn more about this awesome journey of coding because I really think you guys are the true genius in this world full of lies.

Hopefully I will come out (with a lot of research and practice) with other flaw in the blueprints of the death star and send it to George. 

So that's it folks, 
"Do or do not there is no try"
